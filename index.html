    <h1>Jane Doe</h1>
    <div class="job-title">Web Developer</div>
    <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind
        texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.</p>

    <p>A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a
        paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

        ntroducing the CSS Cascade
        The cascade is an algorithm that defines how user agents combine property values originating from different
        sources. The cascade defines the origin and layer that takes precedence when declarations in more than one
        origin or cascade layer set a value for a property on an element.

        The cascade lies at the core of CSS, as emphasized by the name: Cascading Style Sheets. When a selector matches
        an element, the property value from the origin with the highest precedence gets applied, even if the selector
        from a lower precedence origin or layer has greater specificity.

        This article explains what the cascade is and the order in which CSS declarations cascade, covering cascade
        layers and origin type. Understanding origin precedence is key to understanding the cascade.
